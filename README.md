🛒 Cam2Cart – Smart Shopping Assistant
📌 Overview

Cam2Cart is a smart shopping system that uses computer vision and OCR to scan products through a camera and automatically generate a digital shopping cart. The system captures images of products, extracts text (such as product name or price), and stores the information for further processing.

This project aims to make retail shopping faster, smarter, and contactless.
