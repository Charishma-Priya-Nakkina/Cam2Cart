<h2>🛒 Cam2Cart – Smart Shopping Assistant</h2>
<h4>📌 Overview </h4>
            Cam2Cart is a smart shopping system that uses computer vision and OCR to scan products through a camera and automatically generate a digital shopping cart. The system captures images of products, extracts text (such as product name or price), and stores the information for further processing.
This project aims to make retail shopping faster, smarter, and contactless.

<h4>🎯 Objectives </h4>
To automate product identification using a camera.
<br>
To extract text from product images using OCR.
<br>
To generate a digital cart without manual barcode scanning.
<br>
To reduce human effort in billing systems.

<h4>🛠️ Technologies Used </h4>
Hardware: ESP32-CAM
<br>
Programming Language: Python
<br>
Libraries & Tools: OpenCV,Tesseract OCR,NumPy,Versel (for server)
<br>
Database: MongoDB
<br>
Platform: IoT + Computer Vision

<h4>⚙️ System Architecture </h4>
ESP32-CAM captures the product image.
<br>
Image is sent to the server via Wi-Fi.
<br>
OpenCV preprocesses the image.
<br>
Tesseract OCR extracts text.
<br>
Extracted data is stored in the database.
<br>
Digital cart is updated.

<h4>🚀 Features</h4>
Real-time product scanning
<br>
